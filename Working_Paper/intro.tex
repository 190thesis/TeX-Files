\section{Introduction to the Problem}
"Viral Marketing" is a term first introduced in 1997 by Steve Jurvetson and Time Draper\cite{viralmarketing}. It is an effective way of advertising a product to a large group of people by having little groups eventually spread awareness to your product. Companies make a commercial with this in mind. Many over-the-top and absurd commercial having been making rounds across the internet \cite{commercialrise}. First, being seen by a few people who were entertained by the commercial enough for them to hit the share button creating a network to other people who will eventually see the commercial shared by their friend and promptly clicking the share button themselves. Thus, repeating the cycle and expanding the network. 

Online social networks are a good medium to advertise on. Viral Marketing on online social networks is a very cost-effective technique that most companies today utilize. For only spending a few dollars, the payoff can be amazing.\cite{viralmarketing} In 1996, this strategy was used by the once popular e-mail service Hotmail: Every mail sent via Hotmail contained advertisement for the service. A total of \$50,000 was spent on this campaign. Hotmail expanded into 12 million users in just 18 months.\cite{viralmarketing} 

Recently, the video game company Epic Games, used this tactic to advertise their new battle royale game "Fortnite" and it gave astounding results. The number one video streaming site, Youtube, is a very large network and resource to put to use. They sponsored Youtubers with hundred to millions of subscribers to promote their game.\cite{sponsoredvideos} Youtuber Evan Fong "VanossGaming" was one of the content creators Epic Games sponsored for advertising the beta release of Fortnite \cite{vanoss}. He currently has 23 million subscribers(August 2018). The video, titled "Fortnite Funny Moments-Launcing the Rocket!(Gameplay)", has garnered 10 million views in a span of a year.

With this in mind, finding the set of people to target would be ideal. \textbf{Target Set Selection} is basically finding the smallest set of people in a social network to influence all of the people in said network.\cite{Kempe,chen,Shakarian:2012:LSN:2456719.2457081} This network can be represented with a graph $G$ with each person as a node/vertex $V$. Connecting each node/vertex $V$ is an edge $E$. Connected vertices are considered neighbors $n$. The degree $d(v)$ of each node is how many neighbors a node has. The threshold $k(v)$ of each node is a factor to gauge the suceptability of a node from being influenced. The neighbor $N(v)$ is the set of neighbors of the node.
